# IntelligentCPUSchedulerSimulator
 This project provides users—such as students, educators, and developers—a hands-on platform to understand how different scheduling strategies impact system performance. The simulator supports classic algorithms including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (with configurable time quantum), and Priority Scheduling
